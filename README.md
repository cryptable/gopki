# gopki
Tiny PKI for microservices to implement 2-way SSL and from P2P or policy based verification based on cryptographic certificates.
This will be tightly integrated into Kubernetes clusters where it will first be conceived for.
This is the central server which shall communicate with different kind of integrations:
- go http integration (SSL and certificate validation)
- Spring PKI

Any other ideas are welcome
